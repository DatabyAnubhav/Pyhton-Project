# Pyhton-Project

Project Overview:
---------------------------------------------------------
The HR team lacked a streamlined process to generate and maintain multiple personnel datasets, leading to manual errors. 

Develop an automated solution to construct and manage three interconnected data sheets for HR operation. 
Programmed data ingestion and structuring routines using Pandas and NumPy to build the three required sheets (e.g., employee master, performance metrics, promotion eligibility). Implemented data manipulation logic with lambda functions and for loops to add, remove, or update records dynamically. Encapsulated promotion and demotion criteria into reusable Python functions, enabling rule-based adjustments across datasets. 


Conclusion:
-----------------------------------------------
Delivered an end-to-end Python solution with over 95% accuracy in data operations, significantly reducing manual workload and ensuring reliable workforce analytics for timely HR decision-making.
